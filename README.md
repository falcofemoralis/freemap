Wikipedia map. The idea is that any person could mark any geographic object on earth. Current maps (such as Google maps) only provide basic locations, roads, etc., but there are lot of places where people create unspoken paths, roads, etc. So in this development, anyone can add a road, path or even objects.

1) You can open any object and see information about it (for example, it will be possible to add images, videos, links to wikis, etc.). In addition, it is possible to post comments.
2) Sorting objects by category (each object will have to have a tag when it is created). For example, you can see what sights are in the city (or outside the city), etc.
3) Since each user will have his own account, you can add different features (by type of user rating or lvl)
